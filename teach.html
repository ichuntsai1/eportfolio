	<p>Since 2004, I have been working as a trainer, TA, and instructor for courses on learning technologies and multimedia development. As a trainer and instructor, I have applied what I have learned about teacher education at Tamkang University. With the Zone and SISLT courses I have taught, I have about 3 years of online teaching experience. I have great confidence in my teaching knowledge and skills in face-to-face and online courses. In addition, I have a number of skills in multimedia development, such as video, image and audio editing, animation development, web development. The software and programming skills that I use in teaching or training include iMovie, iPhoto, Photoshop, PhotoImpace, Flash, Audacity (audio), Dreamweaver, Captivate and Camtasia (video tutorial creation), Nvu, XHTML, XML (web-casting), Javascript, MySQL, and Morae. Also, I have applied my knowledge and skills of instructional design, interface design, and learning technologies to designing and developing instruction, video and audio tutorials, assessment rubrics, projects, and assignments. Currently, I am an instructor teaching four courses for the Instructional Technology program of the Department of Educational Foundations and Leadership at University of Akron. </p>

classroom to facilitating learning in an increasingly virtual classroom. Successful
online teaching requires an understanding of the relationships between technology
and the learning process, and the ability to design learning environments that support
self-directed and self-regulated learning. Students will examine the affect of online
learning environments on the teaching/learning process and issues related to learner
motivation and task management. This course will examine specific technologies that
support either teaching or learning, explore strategies for effective integration of
technology into instruction and criteria for assessing the utility of a specific technology.
