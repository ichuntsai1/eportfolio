              <p> SISLT at the University of Missouri-Columbia, along with partners at the University of Michigan and Virginia Tech, received a three-year grant (2007-9) to advance the use of CANS and to evaluate its impact on teaching and learning experiences and practices by the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education (FIPSE) of the US Department of Education. (Copy on Project Website)<br />
	<br />As a FIPSE project member, my primary responsibilities are to take the lead in research  which includes design, implementation, data collection, data analysis, and the writing of research reports to assist the design process. I also work on prototypes of social awareness notification tools that we are designing. In this project, we have designed many mockups and prototypes of tools have and implemented several formative evaluations via interviews, focus group discussions, and usability tests. <br />
Additionally, I helped build partnership with East China Normal University in Shanghai for extending research opportunities around FIPSE project.

              <p>The Elementary Science Teaching Community (ESTC) project seeks to improve elementary science teaching through the development of an innovative form of continuous professional development. The project seeks to build knowledge about the central tasks of learning to teach elementary school science across the teacher professional continuum (TPC), about forming and sustaining a communities of practice (COP) for elementary science teaching that spans the TPC, and about ways in which online systems can invite participation and support social learning within a COP and facilitate engagement in the central tasks of learning to teach.<br />
		<p>As a primary investigator, I help design and implement the study by establishing environment of ESTC; develop online surveys and interview protocols; collect data via surveys, interviews, and focus groups; analyze qualitative and quantitative data; and write research reports. I learned both perspectives of Teacher Education and Learning Science from the professors I worked with.</p>

              <p>This research project explicated the construct of social ability and examined the relationship between student interactions in the Sakai system. We conducted usability tests in Fall 2005 in order to understand how students learn through the course system. A phase I usability test was conducted in Fall 2005 and a phase II usability test was conducted in Winter 2005. In phase II, social awareness widgets are used in Sakai. The researchers would like to investigate how widgets influence students learning and interactions in the course system.</p>
	<p>In this study, I served as a co-investigator. I reviewed literature in order to propose appropriate research methods and coding schemes, conducted usability tests to collect data, and analyzed qualitative data in order to write up reports based on this data.</p>

              <p>The purpose of this study was to explore students' online learning experiences, including self-efficacy, motivation, social ability, tool use, and learning satisfaction. This research explicated the construct of social ability and examined the relationship between students' motivation and social ability in online learning environments. The study identified five factors that defined social ability: social presence with students, social presence with instructor, social navigation, concerns for social interaction, and confidence in social interaction. Additionally, an analysis of canonical correlations indicated that significant and meaningful relationships exist between academic motivation and online social ability.<br />
	<p>As a co-investigator. I reviewed literature and other instruments to propose the understanding of social interaction of online learning environments and appropriate instruments. I also participated in data collection by interviewing students and analyzing the qualitative and quantitative data using a created coding scheme and applied Factor Analysis to generate findings reports, and submit an AERA proposal.</p>

              <p>The purpose of this study was to explore the social nature of three domains of social activity, including networked multiplayer games, online learning, and traditional face-to-face courses. We interviewed students who have experience in playing multiplayer games and learning in both online courses and face-to-face courses. These three domains of social activity were to identify important dimensions of how technology mediates social experience and how the social nature of activity motivates participation and supports learning.<br />
	<p>As a co-investigator, I reviewed the relevant literature and instruments on student interaction in different learning environments in order to propose the understanding of social interaction of online learning environments and appropriate instruments. I also helped to collect data by interviewing students, analyze qualitative data by creating coding scheme using NVivo and to ground the themes of students' behaviors in these environments.</p>

              <p> This project investigated how computer-mediated collaborative concept mapping has been applied in assisting student learning. It reviewed studies of computer-mediated collaborative concept mapping. Our purpose was to present our findings in a paper in which we critically reviewed and analyzed previous research on collaborative concept mapping in both face-to-face and networked environments. Newly developed concept mapping software which operates via the Internet now enables distance learners to implement concept mapping as a learning tool for co-constructing knowledge. Based on our analysis of current research, we provided some directions for future research in the use of concept mapping for online learning. The study has been completed and its results have been presented in the CSCL2005 conference. <br />
	<p>Collaborating with two colleagues, I helped review empirical studies from a database, collect articles, analyze articles, identify research themes, and flesh out the paper based on these themes. The process of working with others and writing a review paper enabled  me to learn how to ground themes from the data and to present them logically. </p>

	<p>SAs a Reflector staff member and a mentor in the Zone in Summer and Fall 2005, I was assigned to the LisRadio Project to develop instructions for setting up a webcasting system. The instructions were designed for the Reflector staff. When other project members and I worked on the instructions, we also assisted Library Science professors in setting up a radio system and in webcasting radio shows. It was a very interesting experience.</p>
