<h3><a name="process">Evaluation Process</a></h3>

<p>Alison Krempald acted as my experienced HTML developer and was able to offer some suggestions to my designs.  She evaluated my site remotely and then e-mailed the evaluation report with her comments.</p>

<p>Christine Lawston is my web site content expert.  She has been managing businesses for many years and is very familiar with the concepts discussed on my site.  She has also had to use these concepts in her own work.  She reviewed my site remotely and e-mailed the evaluation form back to me upon completion.</p>

<p>Debbie Kennedy acted as my observation subject.  I was able to sit beside her and observe her navigating through the pages of my site as I took notes.  Afterwards, she completed the evaluation and e-mailed a copy to me for my report.</p>

<p>Jonathan Miller is a part of my target audience.  He is looking to start his own business and is interested in how to get started.  He reviewed the site remotely and then e-mailed the evaluation form to me.</p>

<h3><a name="comments">Comments and Observations</a></h3>

<p><b>Design:</b>  The design portion of my site was rated very well overall.  Everyone agreed that the organization and graphic design principles in my site were acceptable.  Navigation seemed relatively easy for everyone, as well, and the homepage link was shown on every page, so that everyone could find their way back to the begginning of the site without problem.  Text was evaluated as mostly easy to read.</p>  

<p>Alison Krempald suggested that I add a &quot;Return to Top&quot; link at the end of the text on the &quot;Example&quot; page.  Debbie Kennedy noted that visitors might appreciate any long paragraphs to be broken into smaller ones for easier reading. I noticed Debbie losing her place when reading a long paragraph and trying to find it with the cursor when I was observing her.  Jonathan Miller suggested that the italicized font style used on the bottom of the page be removed to make it easier to read.</p>  

<p>Fortunately, everyone understood the purpose of having an image of a chess game, since chess requires strategic thinking similar to that used in strategic planning.  The site loaded quickly which was probably also due to the good computer systems and internet connections of my evaluators.  The ALT, HEIGHT, and WIDTH were included in my code, and the site was also judged to be accessible.</p>

<p><b>Content:</b>  The evaluators found several problems with the content of my site.  I had mistakenly copied code from one page to another and copied the same title to another page.  I tend to look at the page, and often forget to look at the title bar, so I am grateful that they caught this error.</p>  

<p>Although my links were easy to read, my &quot;Return to Assignments Page&quot; and two of my &quot;Resources&quot; links did not function.  I watched Debbie Kennedy try several times to open these links, and then giving up and moving on to other parts of the site when the links would not work.</p>  

<p>My &quot;Return to Assignments Page&quot; link was in another directory, so I had to revise my code accordingly.  As for my &quot;Resources&quot;, there were typos in my links that needed corrected, and I also found that one link required the letter &quot;o&quot; to be capitalized, and it would not function when I used a lower-case &quot;o&quot;.  Alison Krempald also encouraged me to have external links on the &quot;Resources&quot; pages open in a new window.
</p>
  
<p>My content is not embedded in numerous multiple layers, so it was easy for everyone to follow.  The content was judged to be accurate, current, and stimulated thinking and reflection.  Christine Lawston, my content expert, encouraged me to add more content to explain the concepts more thoroughly.</p>

<p><b>Credibility:</b>  The evaluators agreed that credibility had been established.  A contact person and e-mail were provided on every page.  The site was not judged to be biased, except for promoting the concepts of strategic planning, which was the purpose of the site. Appropriate citations and credit were given with no copyright infringement.</p>

<p>There were several corrections to spelling and grammar that needed to be made.  I had also forgotten to indicate when the page was last updated.  Once again, these are mistakes that I overlooked and thank my evaluators for their keen eyes and attention.</p> 

<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></p>

<h3><a name="changes">Changes and Responses</a></h3>

<p>The feedback given by the evaluators was excellent, and I plan to incorporate all of their suggestions into my site. Although I am still in the process of working on my site, I have gradually been making the needed corrections.</p>  

<p>Before my site is submitted, it will have properly labled title bars for each page, correctly functioning links, additional content, correct spelling and grammar, and a date for the last update. This will make it easier to navigate and read, as well as give it a more professional appearance.</p>  

<p>I will also add &quot;Return to Top&quot; links for any long pages and break up large paragraphs into smaller ones.  My external links will be fixed to open in a new window.  The italicized font style for the information shown at the bottom of each page has already been removed, and is now easier to read.</p>  

<p>All of these changes will contribute to improving the visual appeal, content, functionality, and overall quality of my site.</p>

<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></p>

<h3><a name="methods">Testing Methods</a></h3>

<p>Using a variety of testing methods is an excellent idea since visitors to a site often have diverse backgrounds, skills, and computer systems.  I greatly appreciated the advice that I received regarding the quality of my content, coding, layout, design, and general presention of my site.</p>  

<p>I was fortunate to have the evaluators share their opinions with me since I am a complete beginner in creating websites.  I now have a  greater understanding of web development as a result of their feedback.  It is beneficial to have an experienced HTML developer review my code and check for errors that I would not have found by myself.</p> 

<p>The opportunity to observe an evaluator use my site was invaluable, too, because it helped me to view my site from another's perspective.  It is easy to get lost in the detail of designing a site and lose sight of the big picture.  My site was improved tremendously as a result of the evaluators&#39; input.</p>
