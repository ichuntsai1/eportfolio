<li><a name="mary" href="evaluationform_mary_krieger.rtf" title="Click for Mary's Report">Mary Krieger, RN, MLIS</a>-Independent Evaluator - Mary is a reference librarian at the Medical Center Library, in her mid-fifties.  She has been a librarian at MCL  for six years, but has been working in libraries for 10 years. Beginning in 2002 she developed an online course that is a required component of the first-year medical school curriculum and used student suggestions to improve the format.  Mary has a lot of experience working with computers and online formats. Mary might use this site if she needed to cover the circulation desk in an emergency situation. Her evaluation was done on the standard machine all staff use at the library, a Dell Optiplex GX620 with 1 GB RAM 3.4GHz running Windows XP.  Mary did her evaluation on an IE  6.0 browser using ethernet.<br />

<ul><a name="comments"><b>Comments and Observations</b></a>
<ul list-style: none> Most of the evaluators’ comments were very positive and encouraging.  All agreed that the site is clean and uncluttered in terms of design with text and backgrounds that contrast well and are easy to read.  The navigation was also well received with three of the evaluators commenting positively and specifically about the inclusion of “return to top” and “return to home” links.  None of the participants had trouble loading the pictures that are included as examples on the orientation page. <br /><br />
After Anna completed her evaluation she told me that she would find it very useful to have that page always running on the main circulation computers to quick access to the information.<br /><br />Many of the evaluators noted that there is a lack of update and author information on the page.  In addition, while I observed Anna during her test, she caught a number of typos on the Orientation page.  Mary also noted these typos in her evaluation. Lisa noted that a couple of the pages do not pass validation. <br /><br />
Mary made some useful suggestions that include:
<ul><li>Changing the index page header to read Medical Center Library, instead of just 	the abbreviation MCL.</li>
<li>Protecting the page from public view as it has sensitive information regarding opening and closing procedures</li>
<li>A list of library staff including phone numbers and email addresses</li>
<li>Adding information about authorship, including the Access Services Coordinator’s contact information</li>
<a href="evaluation.html">Return to top</a></ul></ul>

<ul><a name="revisions"><b>My Responses and Planned Revisions</b></a>
<ul list-style: none>First, I will update all of the pages to include update information and authorship information.  <br /><br />
I will also follow Mary’s suggestion to add specific contact information for the Access Services Coordinator (me) as well as providing a staff contact list. <br /><br />
Regarding Mary’s suggestion that the page be protected, I had already thought about this and planned to post this page separately from the main MCL page on my personal webpage on the SLU server, until I figured out a way to password protect it. This will be an adjustment I make for real world application of the site, and I will not do it as part of my final project. <br /><br />
I plan on going through and fixing the typos. <br /><br />
At the time of the evaluation I had not run any of my pages through the validator, hence Lisa’s comments, but I do plan on doing this before I submit my final page. <br /><br />
In addition, while Anna was doing her test in IE I noticed that the word document, Frequently Used Reserves, was opening up in the page instead of separately as it did in Firefox, so I will be sure to include a TARGET tag so that the document opens in a new window. </ul>

<ul><a name="testing"><b>Comments About Testing</b></a>
<ul list-style: none>It was very valuable to have other people go through my site.  After spending so much time working on it and focusing on the code instead of the content, I needed a fresh perspective to help me tweak it and make improvements.  <br /><br />
You may have noticed that testing did not occur on a Mac OS or in a Netscape browser.  Before I submit my final work I will test these myself. For the purpose of the page and the people using it, the most important place to test usability would be on a PC using IE or Firefox as those are the systems that the Library uses and this page is intended specifically for in-library use. </ul>
