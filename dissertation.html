      <h2><a name="abstract"></a>ABSTRACT</h2>
	<p>Taking advantage of Internet technology, an online community of practice, NETwork, was established to support a group of elementary science pre-service and in-service teachers' learning how to teach. To better understand how teachers can be supported and sustained while participating in an online community of practice, this study investigated the nature of members' participation, members' perceptions of social constructs of online learning experience, and members' learning in a community of practice. Three primary research questions were asked: 1) How do members participate in the primary learning activities through Chat Room discussion, Discussion Board discussion, and information sharing in Resources?; 2) How well does the proposed path model explain the relationships among the social constructs of online learning (i.e. sense of community, social ability, perceived ease of use, and perceived usefulness) and how well do those social constructs explain community outcomes/effects (satisfaction with NETwork experience and effectiveness of NETwork for Teaching)?; and 3) How do members' perceptions (sense of community, social ability, ease of use, usefulness, satisfaction with their NETwork experience, and of the effectiveness of NETwork for supporting teaching) change through participating in the community?<br /><br />
For research question one, members' log files (Context-aware Activity Notification System data - CANS) were analyzed by social network analysis and visualization techniques to show members' levels and patterns of participation, and qualitative data collected via serial and semester-end interviews and discussion content in the discussion board and chat room were analyzed to triangulate what had been found via CANS data. The results of the analyses show that: 1) members' levels and patterns of participation varied across time, member types, and tools; 2) members' identity and levels of participation were reciprocally associated; 3) There were similarities and differences in members' usage of computer-mediated communication (CMC) tools, and members showed growth of their knowledge and skills for teaching via mutual engagement, creating joint enterprise, and establishing shared repertoire supported by CMC tools; and 4) Lack of time influences members' levels of participation.<br /><br />
For the second research question, quantitative data collected in the final survey were analyzed via path analysis to examine the relationships among the social constructs. The final model of primary social constructs was found to explain how members' perceptions of sense of community (SOC), social ability (SA), and perceived ease of use (PEU) and usefulness (PU) of Sakai tools account for 74% and 80% of variance respectively for members' satisfaction with NETwork experience and effectiveness of NETwork for Teaching. Also, the relationships among sub-constructs of SA and other social constructs provided further understanding of how social navigation, social presence with peers, and social presence with instructors related to members' perceptions of PEU and PU, SOC, and S. <br /><br />
For research question three, data collected in both the first and final surveys were analyzed via dependent-sample t test and qualitative data collected in both the serial and semester-end interviews were analyzed to examine changes in members' perceptions of social constructs. The results show that members' perceptions of social constructs significantly changed after participating in NETwork activities although some social constructs might need more time for changes to be significant. Also, members believe that participating in NETwork is helpful for their current and future teaching.<br /><br /></p>

      <h2><a name="rationale"></a>RATIONALE OF STUDY</h2>
	<p>In the late 1990s online learning started to become an important channel for learning in higher education. Compared to face-to-face learning environments, online learning environments promote flexible collaborative space for learning by providing synchronous and asynchronous opportunities for learning anywhere and anytime. Overall online enrollment increased from 1.98 million in 2003 to 2.35 million in 2004. In 2004, 74% of public institutions of higher education identified online education as critical to their long-term strategy in sustaining learning (Allen & Seaman, 2004). Taking advantage of the ease of access and affordability of the Internet, universities and researchers have been establishing and testing online learning experiences not only for traditional course-based learning but also for communities of practice (CoP). For example, an online teacher community, NETwork (Nurturing Elementary Teachers' work), has been in place using Sakai course management system in order to sustain K-8 science teaching since August 2006. The purpose of NETwork established at University of Missouri is to overcome the current disconnect between teacher education and teaching practice and provide pre-service and in-service teachers a collaborative learning environment. This study is to examine how community of practice is established in this NETwork community through members' participation.</p>

	<h3>Research Purpose</h3>
	<p>According to CoP theory (Wenger, 1998), learning is a process of participating in social interaction and knowledge is constructed through reflection, sharing, and negotiating with others in the community. The purposes of this study are to understand the nature of participation, social constructs, and learning in a Community of Practice and to test a model of how well the social constructs of the online community explain the effectiveness of professional development in a community. First, this study will investigate how members act differently in different types of learning activity, such as sharing resources, Chat Room discussion, and Discussion Board discussion, will be explored. The patterns of members' participation levels across activities will be examined for better understanding of members' participation across time. In addition, the relationships among the social constructs of online interaction (i.e. social ability, sense of community, technology acceptance, learning satisfaction, level of participation, and effectiveness of NETwork for teaching) will be explored in order to understand how social constructs relate to each other and explain community outcomes and effects. A model of social constructs and effectiveness will be examined by testing a proposed structural equation model (SEM) (Figure 1.1) which has been constructed based upon a literature review. Finally, changes of members' participation patterns and changes of members' perception of social constructs will be investigated in order to understand how members' perceptions and behaviors change when participating in NETwork.</p>

	<h3>Research Questions</h3>
	<p>In order to accomplish the purposes of this study, three research questions will be addressed.</p>
	<ul>
	<li>How do members participate in the primary learning activities through Chat Room discussion, Discussion Board discussion, and information sharing in Resources?</li>
	<ol><li>What are the characterizations of member activity that represent different levels of participating in the community? Are there differences in the levels of participating for experienced members and new members and for pre-service and in-service teachers?</li>
	<li>What are the characterizations of member activity that represent different patterns of participating in the community? Are there differences in the patterns of participation for experienced members and new members and for pre-service and in-service teachers?</li>
	</ol>
	<li>How well does the proposed model explain the relationships among the social constructs of online learning (i.e. sense of community, social ability, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness) and explain community outcomes/effects (levels of participation, satisfaction of NETwork experience, and effectiveness of NETwork for Teaching)?</li>
	<li>How do members perceptions of sense of community, social ability, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, satisfaction with their NETwork experience, and perceptions of the effectiveness of NETwork for supporting teaching change through participating in the community?</li>
	</ul>

      <h2><a name="method"></a>METHODOLOGY</h2>
	<p>To answer the three research questions, multiple quantitative and qualitative methods will be employed in order to triangulate members' online learning experience of NETwork community. A set of self-report questionnaires will be administered in order to collect pre-service and in-service teachers' perception of technology acceptance, sense of community, social ability, satisfaction with the NETwork experience, and perceptions of effectiveness of NETwork for supporting teaching. Additionally, semester-end interviews will examine members' summative opinions about how they participated and learned in NETwork and serial interviews will be administered three times in order to capture members' changes of opinions regarding their participation and interaction. Finally, members' activity logs recorded in CANS (Context-aware Activity Notification System, Amelung, 2005) and discussion content recorded in Sakai system will be analyzed to describe members' behaviors.</p>
	<p>In order to accomplish the purposes of this study, four types of data, including quantitative survey data, qualitative interview transcripts, CANS data, and discussion content in DB and CR, will be collected and analyzed. Table below presents how the data will be used for answering the research questions. After that, how each research question will be answered with the collected data is explained.</p>
